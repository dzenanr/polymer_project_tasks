Todo

Old (from the Web UI version)

- strange error:
  update task description by Employee works only if the employee has more than 1 task
  (the new value is there, but not immediately shown in task-table)
  same for update task description by Project, works only if project has more than 1 task

- remove the Save button and save data automatically

+ semantic relationship between Project and Employee is many-to-many
  with Task as the intersection concept:
  Project >--< Employee => Project --< Task >-- Employee
+ Project --< Task relationship is internal;
  Employee --< Task relationship is external
+ projects are saved with their corresponding tasks;
  employees are saved without tasks
+ internal children (project tasks) may be added, edited and removed
+ external children (employee tasks) may be only edited
- introduce additions and removals of employee tasks

New (Polymer.dart)

- test
- use images for buttons
