Polymer.dart 0.16.0+7

- a property update is not displayed in a table although the object is observed
- done: replace a variable with the corresponding concept property
  (e.g., employee.email instead of email)

New (Polymer.dart)

- error (entities.order() with 1 entity does not order and no change is observed):
  update task description by Employee works only if the employee has more than 1 task
  (the new value is there, but not immediately shown in task-table)
  same for update task description by Project, works only if project has more than 1 task
- add tests to the model
- manage add and remove consistency for project tasks and employee tasks in the model
- use @observable in the model (?) for refresh in Polymer UI
- use images for buttons
- remove the Save button and save data automatically

+ semantic relationship between Project and Employee is many-to-many
  with Task as the intersection concept:
  Project >--< Employee => Project --< Task >-- Employee
+ Project --< Task relationship is internal;
  Employee --< Task relationship is external
+ projects are saved with their corresponding tasks;
  employees are saved without tasks
+ internal children (project tasks) may be added, edited and removed
+ external children (employee tasks) may be only edited
+ when a task is added, updated or removed, project tasks and employee tasks
  must be kept consistent (both in the model and in Polymer UI)
- introduce additions and removals of employee tasks
